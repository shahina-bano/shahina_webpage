<h1>Coding Goals (0_0)</h1>
<hr>

  <p>Here Shahina, a first-year Btech student pursuing my graduation from Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women. In the 11th and 12th standards, I opted for CS as my side subject. Since then, my interest builds on coding and solving problems. Guidance from my family and teachers, I took the step in the engineering field.
  </p>
  <p>Afterward, I have started taking part in online coding contests and practicing on online platforms for enhancing my technical skills.
        Here is my profile link on one such coding platform <a href = "https://www.codechef.com/users/shahina5">click here</a>.</p>

		<p>Since 11th and 12th up until now, I have learned HTML, CSS, CPP and DART as programming languages and currently, I am learning Python and Javascript. I have worked on editors like dev, vs code, android studio.
         Currently, I am working on the framework flutter for our RGSOC project which uses dart as the programming language. It is an optimistic framework since it can be used for both an ios as well as an android processor so we don't have to build two different sets of code for different processors. I am learning flutter from online tutorials and websites. Also, the codes that were explained in tutorials are made available to us through the Github repository. </p>

		<p> I am looking forward to more and more new technologies on which I can work to explore things.</p>
